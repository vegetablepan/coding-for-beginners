# Coding-for-beginners

Inspired by a Weibo drawing contest, I am trying to introduce coding to a newbie. This repo contains programming stuff that I would like to introduce to a newbie in order for him/her to develop his/her own bash/git/GitHub workflow, use Python for simple automation tasks, and have the ability to learn further stuff.
